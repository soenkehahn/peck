- copy symlinks correctly
- implement better output on errors (without leaking implementation details like stack traces and YamlException strings)
- provide a --reinstall flag
- implement a --init that creates a simple example config
- don't use shake
- write db file with json for better backwards compatibility
- use db file for locking (with sqlite?)
